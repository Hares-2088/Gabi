## Getting Started with Create React App 🎉

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. Follow these steps to get your app up and running in no time!

### 🚀 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

#### `npm start` 🏃‍♂️
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it!

The page will automatically reload when you make changes.  
Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

#### `npm test` 🧪
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
Refer to the section on running tests for more info.

#### `npm run build` 📦
Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
This command optimizes your app for the best performance.

Your build will be minified, and filenames will include hashes for better caching.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run eject` ⚠️
**Important:** This is a one-way operation! Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you're looking for full control over your build tools and configurations, use this command.  
It will copy all configuration files and dependencies (like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.  
You don’t have to use eject; the curated feature set works well for small and mid-sized deployments!
